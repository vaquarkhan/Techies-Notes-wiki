* **Microservices **architecture is an alternative approach to structuring applications. An application is broken into smaller, completely independent components, enabling them to have greater agility, scalability, and availability.

* **SOA **exposes the functions of applications as more readily accessible service interfaces, making it easier to use their data and logic in the next generation of applications.
