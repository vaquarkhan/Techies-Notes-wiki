### The challenge

Organizations are seeing huge increase in volumes of data. Data is coming from various sources:

* 1. Structured data from databases, web pages, OLTP, etc.
*  2. Employee created unstructured data in form of files, emails, IMs, etc
*  3. Machine generated data from sensors
*  4. Video surveillance feeds
*  5. Misc. user generated data: Photos, videos, pdfs etc
*  6. Data from external feeds: Social networks, Twitter, news sites, web comments etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### According to a study done by Ventana research:

* 78% of organizations are facing challenges in integrating different data sources.
* 55% of companies are somewhat confident or not at all confident in their ability to process lage volumes of data
* 58% doubt their ability to process data that arrives at high velocity.

#### A Unified Data Lake offers several benefits including:

* Agility: Eliminating much of the strain on IT that was common with traditional silo approaches.
* Simplicity: Allow consumption of data in any format, thus saving time & reducing errors
* Flexibility: Allow for the use of different analytics techniques, mix of both old and new, which helps organizations see the data differently to ask new questions and derive new insights
* Accessibility: Provide users with fast, easy and secure access all their data.
